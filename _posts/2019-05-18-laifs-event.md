LACPS will be doing an outreach/fundraiser on June 8th and 9th! We have been offered display and vendor tables (for a fee) at the annual show and sale of the Los Angeles International Fern Societyâ€™s annual show on Ferns and exotic plants. It is held at the beautiful Los Angeles Arboretum in Arcadia CA.

### Who can go

We would encourage all members to attend and participate. Our last event had over a couple thousand dollars in sales, and interactions with hundreds of people who got a newfound interest in CPs. Check the [mailing list](/mailing-list) for details and updates.

### What to expect

Below are pictures of what our booth looked like at the Orange County Pet Expo;
