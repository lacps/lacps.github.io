To keep abreast of LACPS announcements or participate in electronic LA CP discussion, join our group on Matrix.org.

To receive message notifications on your phone, first download the [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/vector/id1083446067) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app) Element app, then scan the below QR code with your camera or bar code reader to connect to the group.

...or manually add [#lacps:matrix.org](#lacps:matrix.org) in the app.

You can also join and access the group via your [browser](https://matrix.to/#/!DXmAThJLnBqekJPuum:matrix.org?via=matrix.org), but will lose out on message notifications without the Element app installed on your phone.

### Twitter

You might also [follow LACPS on twitter](https://twitter.com/lacarnivores); however, few members are connected there and interaction is limited.

### Other Carnivorous Plant Clubs

California is also home to the [BACPS](https://www.bacps.org/), [SDCPS](https://www.sandiegocarnivorousplantsociety.com/), and [SCCPE](https://sccpe.org/). 

Should you be looking for a CP group in another geographic area, the [CP FAQ](http://www.sarracenia.com/faq.html) maintains a [list of carnivorous plant societies](http://sarracenia.com/faq/faq6100.html).

### Other Carnivorous Plant Resources

For yet more verbiage and photos to feed your carnivorous plant frenzy, any of the following could fit the bill:
* [International Carnivorous Plant Society](http://carnivorousplants.org/)
* [CPUK Forum](http://www.cpukforum.com/) (it ain't just for Brits)
* [CP FAQ](http://www.sarracenia.com/faq.html), which includes a list of [other carnivorous plant societies](http://sarracenia.com/faq/faq6100.html).
