<p>"At the next meeting, our presenter will be Peter D'Amato of Savage Garden fame.</p>
<p>Peter is a member of the Bay Area Society. We want to show him an LA greeting, so everyone is encouraged to wear our LACPS shirt.</p>
<p>For one time only, our admission will be as follows:</p>
<p>- $3.00 wearing a shirt. A shirt can also be purchased from DJ at meeting<br />
- $5.00 if dressed as a civilian. The $2.00 difference will be applied towards dressing Peter for success and respect in the CP world."</p></div></div></div>
