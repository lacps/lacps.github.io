After a long COVID-19 induced pause, the LACPS will reconvene on April 17 for the first time in what feels like an eternity. 

### What to Expect

### Where to Go

The meeting will be held in Alhambra at a location to be announced.

### Sales and Trades

As usual, plants to show, sell, or trade are welcome. You are also welcome to walk around with your plants hidden in a bag if you aren't yet ready to be as social as in the Before Times.
