<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I am so happy that we will soon all congregate at the greenhouses to enjoy each others company and plants. Spring is definitely in the air and the plants are showing off. You will have plenty to see and enjoy. </p>
<p>The meeting will not have a speaker but I will have some announcements. </p></div></div></div>
