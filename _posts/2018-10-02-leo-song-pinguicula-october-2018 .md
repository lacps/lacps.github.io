[Leo Song](https://www.instagram.com/leochulsongjr/) will be speaking about *Pinguicula* at the October LACPS meeting.

Dr. Song is the former greenhouse manager at California State University Fullerton and a living legend in carnivorous plant circles. Amongst other things, he is known for pioneering *Amorphophallus titanum* and *Welwitschia mirabilis* cultivation, and is responsible for the widely-grown *Dionaea muscipula* 'Jaws' and *Pinguicula* 'Titan' cultivars. Peter D'Amato recently named *Sarracenia* ‘Leo Song’ in his honor.

### What to Expect

*Pinguicula* (Butterworts). Do they captivate or mystify you? Come hear all about the wonderful cultivation of this survivor Carnivorous plant. Some can live with no water for an entire winter; some can live with no media contact. Curious plants and though delicate looking they are quite mighty and quite easy to maintain in normal household conditions.

### Where to Go

The meeting will convene on Saturday, October 20, 2018 at the [Alhambra Chamber of Commerce building](/meetings). The doors will open when Tom arrives, which is usually around 10:45AM.

### Sales and Trades

As usual, plants to show and sell are welcome.
