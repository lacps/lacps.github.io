The April 21th 2018 meeting will be this Saturday at the [California State University Fullerton Biology Greenhouse Complex](http://biology.fullerton.edu/facilities/greenhouse/).

### Meeting notes from Ed Read:

_I look forward to seeing you all and your plants at the April 21st meeting that I am hosting at the [CSUF Biology Greenhouse Complex](http://biology.fullerton.edu/facilities/greenhouse/). With spring here we are loving the beautiful weather and the wonderful show of Sarracenia flowers and pitchers.

Doors open at 10am and the meeting can go to noon. $3. I will have refreshments.

Please remember that this is a standing and walking event. I will have a couple of chairs available, just ask.
Please remember that this is a research facility, so please no tampering with the plants and if you bring children you must keep a close eye on them at all times for their safety._

### Carnivorous Plants Welcome

As usual, everyone is encouraged to bring plants for show, sale, or trade.
