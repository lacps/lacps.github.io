<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>The aging of Alhambra's cat population has caused a resurgence of the rodent residents, forcing Alhambra to find another way to control these undesirables. In a novel approach, the City Council consulted with LACPS' Warren and, in conjunction with the Huntington Gardens, settled on using a botanical control. Based on Warren's recommendation, the city planted Triffid DJensis aroound the city. The rodent population showed an immediate drop. Strangely enough, the aged cats disappeared--probably moved to Florida.</p>
