<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>The June 18, 2011 LACPS meeting will be held at the <a href="http://www.huntington.org">Huntington Library and Botanical Gardens</a> from 10:30am to 1:30 or 2:30pm.</p>
<p>Due to changes at the Huntington you will need to sign-up in person at our regular February or April meetings. If you do not sign up in advance we cannot guarantee you free admission and a space on the tour. You will probably have to pay the regular admission fees to enter the grounds. Should you wish to pursue alternate means of admission, try the <a href="/mailing-list">LACPS mailing list</a>.</p>
