### Meeting details from Ed Read

Hello everyone,

I am so happy that we meet again at the greenhouses for another LACPS meeting.
Spring is definitely in the air and the plants are showing off. You will have plenty to see and enjoy.

If we are lucky, the latest Titan Arum aka Corpse Flower will open up Friday night and be in full glory Saturday morning for the meeting. See the above photo that I just took today.

For directions to the meeting see the above map.
From the 57 exit Nutwood Avenue and go west toward campus. On the corner of Nutwood and State College Blvd. is the Nutwood Parking structure. Park there and walk out the NE corner and follow the footpath east. You will see the tall red brick wall and the huge white water tower as you head east. Follow this red perimeter wall clockwise (turn right at the corner) and you will arrive to an entrance gate. Enter and continue straight in until you see the open door of the head house.
We are asking a $3 donation and will provide refreshments.
Please bring in plants to sell/trade. I would like to acquire Aldrovanda and Cephalotus with provenance:)

A few students have volunteered to help out and they are happy to answer any questions that you may have. There will be a cart available (first come first serve) to carry your plants but many of you savvy growers already have something with wheels to truck things back and forth. Reverse osmosis water will be available for your plants. Feel free to take photos. Everyone is nice so don't be shy to introduce yourself and ask questions. I will try as always to help answer questions and discuss things.

If you plan on bringing youngsters please know that you will need to keep a keen eye on them at all times. My son has revealed many hazards that I hadn't realized and that's not including all of the dangerous and poisonous plants! So, all children must be accompanied and supervised by their adult at all times.

Please no touching plants or plant tags! What was the data on this rare plant ??? Hmm, it had a tag the last time that I saw it but what happened? Has this ever happened to you? Well it happens here and it is a royal bummer so please never pull up or touch our fragile plant tags to see what it says. Ask me if you really need to know. Just as it is common courtesy to ask before petting a dog; it is common courtesy to ask before touching a plant and especially important to ask permission to touch a tag.

Student research is in progress in the lath house and greenhouses and it isn't always obvious what is being used so please observe with your eyes only.

Restrooms are in the building north of the greenhouses. See the photo map I posted.

There will be a table in the lath house to stage your plants for show or trade. Remember to be courteous and never pick up a plant without asking it's owner. Putting your name by your trays is a good way to help people find you so that they can talk with you about them. It's remarkable how many of us can just tell who the owner is by how nice they look and what they are. Game on folks!

A big thanks from me to the LACPS members who have done a great job at keeping the meetings going and advancing the hobby here in our beautiful Los Angeles and Orange County.
