The April 6th 2019 LACPS meeting will be held at the [California State University Fullerton Biology Greenhouse Complex](http://biology.fullerton.edu/facilities/greenhouse/) from 10:00 to noon.

### What to Expect

The Biology Greenhouse Complex (BGC) provides space and facilities to teach labs and conduct research. Hidden behind a perimeter of brick wall and unknown to many non-biology students, the complex includes four glass houses, a lath house, a head house, and a large outdoor area. It also houses a diverse collection of plants for use in the biology lectures and labs. Hundreds of students pass through the greenhouses each semester as they learn about plants and biodiversity. Edward Read, the greenhouse manager, and his assistants are constantly working to maintain the grounds and the diverse plant collection.
