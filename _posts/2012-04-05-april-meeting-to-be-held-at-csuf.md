Here are details on the venue from greenhouse director Ed Read:</p>
<p>I'm so happy to see that the group would like to meet at the greenhouses again; I really enjoy having the group over. The Sarracenia and Pinguicula are in full bloom now and we just finished repotting the Nepenthes. There will be lots of Sarracenia, Pinguicula, and Nepenthes cuttings up for grabs. </p></div></div></div>
