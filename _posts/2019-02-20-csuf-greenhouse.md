The April 6th 2019 LACPS meeting will be held at the [California State University Fullerton Biology Greenhouse Complex](http://biology.fullerton.edu/facilities/greenhouse/) from 10:00 to noon.

### What to Expect

The Biology Greenhouse Complex (BGC) provides space and facilities to teach labs and conduct research. Hidden behind a perimeter of brick wall and unknown to many non-biology students, the complex includes four glass houses, a lath house, a head house, and a large outdoor area. It also houses a diverse collection of plants for use in the biology lectures and labs. Hundreds of students pass through the greenhouses each semester as they learn about plants and biodiversity. Edward Read, the greenhouse manager, and his assistants are constantly working to maintain the grounds and the diverse plant collection.

The BGC is located just west of McCarthy Hall. The entrance is near the middle of the east perimeter wall. See the [CSUF campus map](http://www.fullerton.edu/campusmap/).

The greenhouses are north of entrance 2.

Please be aware that this is mainly a walking/standing event. There are limited chairs. Children also must be attended at all times.

### Sales and Trades

Plants are welcomed to be brought for showing/trading/selling as always but you may be so taken by the greenhouse carnivorous plant collection and see little else. The meeting starts and ends on time.
