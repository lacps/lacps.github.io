Our guest speaker in the month of August will be Horticulturist Shawn Shumaker, managing horticulturist at the Santa Barbara Orchid Estate and carnivorous plant enthusiast.

### What to Expect

Shawn has prepared an exciting presentation on *Nepenthes* that covers their cultivation, potting techniques, and propagation. You will not only learn some of Shawn's tried-and-true cultivation methods, but there will be a demo of a few of his techniques as well. For the demo, a *Nepenthes* will be available for attendees to use to make their own cuttings using Shawnâ€™s rooting methods.

Do not miss this opportunity to learn from an expert and go home with a little surprise!

### Where to Go

The meeting will convene on Saturday, August 18, 2017 at the [Alhambra Chamber of Commerce building](/meetings). The doors will open when Tom arrives, which is usually around 10:45AM.

### Sales and Trades

As usual, plants to show and sell are welcome.
