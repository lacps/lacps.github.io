This page is hosted on Github pages; we do not have control over or substantial insight into their activites. Github likely logs the IP addresses of visitors in their access logs and probably also logs which pages you visit on this website. The company could also engage in other tracking or data logging activities. Github's privacy policy is available at [https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement).

Our email list is hosted by groups.io. Their privacy policy is located at [https://groups.io/static/privacy](https://groups.io/static/privacy). It appears that groups.io is currently far more restrained in use of subsriber data than are most tech companies; however, that could change at any time and we have no influence over their actions.
