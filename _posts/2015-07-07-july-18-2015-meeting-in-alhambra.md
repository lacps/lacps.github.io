<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>In a departure from the overwhelming precedent set by its long, illustrious history of meeting on even numbered months, the LACPS will meet in July. July 18, 2015, to be exact. Tom Johnson has publicly claimed that the month for the meeting was temporarily changed on this occasion (and this occasion only) due to scheduling conflicts; rumor has it that he simply harbors a deep-seated fondness for July and felt compelled to honor the month's grandeur by gracing it with an LACPS meeting. </p></div></div></div>
