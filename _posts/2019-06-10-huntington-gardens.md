### Sales and Trades

You are welcome to bring plants to show-and-tell, trade or whatever. Be aware the Huntington staff are trained to prevent people leaving the garden areas with plants. This has not been a problem in the past but could be. Be prepared to transport your plants across the large parking lot depending on where you find parking.
