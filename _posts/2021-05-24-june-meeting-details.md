Look for us in the northwestern part of the park, about where marked in the map above. There are multiple picknick tables in the area that cannot be reserved; to find the exact meeting area, look for where the carnivorous plants and the plant people are clustered.

Please RSVP by responding on the [LACPS Mailing List](/mailing-list) if you think you can make it so we can know how many attendees to expect.

### What to Expect

Rare and unusual Plants for sale, and rare and unusual people to chat with!

### Sales and Trades

As always, plants to show, sell, or trade are welcome.

### Other CP Opportunities

Also coming up in June, the WHOLE WEEKEND of the 19th and 20th, is the SUPER-exciting SCCPE Show and Sale!  LACPS will have a table there, so anyone who would like to participate, maybe bring some plants to show off, hang out and talk to people who want to find out about the Club and CP, talk to DJ for details.
