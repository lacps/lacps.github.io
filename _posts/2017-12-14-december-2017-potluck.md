Our December 16th 2017 meeting will be a Potluck. The meeting will convene at the [Alhambra Chamber of Commerce building](http://lacps.net/where-to-go). Doors open when Tom arrives, which is usually around 10:45 AM.

### Notes on Potluck Etiquette from Amy

Make/bring what you like to eat; most likely other people will like it too!

Don't be shy about eating if you didn't bring anything. No one should go hungry. One time I saw people not eating, and I was like, aren't you hungry? And they said, well, we didn't bring anything. So, don't sit there and starve. Skeletons are boring conversationalists.

### Carnivorous Plants Welcome

As usual, everyone is encouraged to bring plants for show, sale, or trade.
