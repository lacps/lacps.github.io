<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>This is Ed Read writing to give details on the meeting coming up on Saturday April 19th. I am very excited to see everyone again! There should be a good turnout as always and I expect to see several new and old faces. The Sarracenia are looking super this week with lots of flowers and the flytraps are full of new growth. Generally speaking, spring growth is showing off.</p></div></div></div>
