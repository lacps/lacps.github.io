LACPS will be doing an outreach/fundraiser In June! We have been offered display and vendor tables (for a fee) at the annual show and sale of the Los Angeles International Fern Societyâ€™s annual show on Ferns and exotic plants. It is held at the beautiful Los Angeles Arboretum in Arcadia CA.

The Los Angeles International Fern Society was formed to provide a source of information on ferns, to arrange for people to study ferns and to encourage the use and enjoyment of ferns. In a more general way, the Society aims to encourage all horticultural activities by example, education, exhibits and donations.

We would encourage all members to attend and participate. Our last event had over a couple thousand in sales, and interactions with hundreds of people who got a newfound interest in CPs. Check the [mailing list](/mailing-list) for details and updates.

Below is a picture of what our booth looked like at the Orange County Pet Expo;
