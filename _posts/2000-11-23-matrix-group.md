You can also access the group via your [browser](https://matrix.to/#/!DXmAThJLnBqekJPuum:matrix.org?via=matrix.org), but will lose out on notifications without installing the Element app on your phone.

### Twitter

You might also [follow LACPS on twitter](https://twitter.com/lacarnivores), but few members are connected there and interaction is limited.

### Other Carnivorous Plant Clubs

California is also home to the [BACPS](https://www.bacps.org/), [SDCPS](https://www.sandiegocarnivorousplantsociety.com/), and [SCCPE](https://sccpe.org/). 

Should you be looking for a CP group in another geographic area, the [CP FAQ](http://www.sarracenia.com/faq.html) maintains a [list of carnivorous plant societies](http://sarracenia.com/faq/faq6100.html).

### Other Carnivorous Plant Resources

For yet more verbiage and photos to feed your carnivorous plant frenzy, any of the following could fit the bill:
* [International Carnivorous Plant Society](http://carnivorousplants.org/)
* [CPUK Forum](http://www.cpukforum.com/) (it ain't just for Brits)
* [CP FAQ](http://www.sarracenia.com/faq.html), which includes a list of [other carnivorous plant societies](http://sarracenia.com/faq/faq6100.html).
