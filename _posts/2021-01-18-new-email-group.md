Due to the closure of Yahoo Groups, the LACPS has migrated to the [groups.io](https://groups.io/g/lacps/) email platform. If you were subscribed to the old group, you will need to subscribe again to the new one. We are not able to unilaterally add email addresses to the new email roster!

Subscribe via the form below or by sending an email to [lacps+subscribe@groups.io](mailto:lacps+subscribe@groups.io).

### Signal

We also have a brand new group on the increasingly-popular [Signal Messenger](https://signal.group/#CjQKIM7iSG2QLwULsO2hI7EKNUw6p2eYVuahPNrTwFWaB3zHEhAGcBOfY6JeEJu6KalL94Vh) platform.

### Matrix

If you are a particularly adventuresome consumer of technology, LACPS announcements are also posted to a new [matrix group](https://matrix.to/#/!DXmAThJLnBqekJPuum:matrix.org?via=matrix.org).

Scan the above QR code with your device or manually add #lacps:matrix.org in the app.

If you don't yet use Matrix, you will need to download and set up the [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/vector/id1083446067) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app) Element app.
