<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>The June LACPS meeting at the <a href="http://www.huntington.org">Huntington Library and Botanical Gardens</a> presents two temporary breaks from tradition; it is scheduled for the second Saturday of the month (June 9) rather than the third, and also requires prior signup to guarantee admission.</p>
<p>Lest you be confused (perhaps inevitable under the circumstances), please do check the <a href="http://lacps.net/mailing-list">LACPS mailing list</a> for details.</p>
