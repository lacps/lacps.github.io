Should you wish to keep abreast of Los Angeles Carnivorous Plant Society-themed announcements or dare to participate in electronic LA CP discussions, the best way to do so is to join the LACPS group on Matrix.org.

To do so and receive notifications on your phone, downloading the [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/vector/id1083446067) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.vector.app) Element app, then scan the below QR code with your camera to connect to the group.

You can also access the group via your [browser](https://matrix.to/#/!DXmAThJLnBqekJPuum:matrix.org?via=matrix.org), but will lose out on notifications without installing the Element app on your phone.

You might also [follow LACPS on twitter](https://twitter.com/lacarnivores), but few members are connected there and interaction there is limited.
