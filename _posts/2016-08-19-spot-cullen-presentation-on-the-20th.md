<p>This is our once a decade Tasmanian meeting: Spot Cullen is visiting us from Tasmania</p>
<p>We are expecting a memorable meeting (No pressure on Spot).  Put on your calendar, in your cell phone, write it on your wrist, have your dog remind you, etc.  But be there! Brush up on your Tasmanian and plan to attend.</p>
<p>Bring plants to show off or sell.  Bring $3 bills for the admission (or at least not $20s or larger).</p></div></div></div>
