<p>Just a reminder that our last meeting of the year will be the 19th.  Plan to bring food and plants (not necessarily in that order) to the meeting.  We will not have a program, but we will have the ever popular business meeting.  It is a good way to clear a building.  It will be your last chance to buy a t-shirt Christmas present, and in hard to find sizes.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://lacps.net/where-to-go" alt="" title="Where To Go">Alhambra Chamber of Commerce building</a> will host the event; doors open at around 10:30.</p>
